# Blue-Gravity-Clothes-Shop
Unity 2021.3.2f1 (https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.2#release-notes)

For this task, create a functional clothes shop within a simulation game reminiscent of 'The Sims' and 'Stardew Valley'. The game should feature a top-down view like Stardew Valley, not a side-scrolling, platformer, or bird's-eye view.
